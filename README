## schematic of the workflow

The workflow is composed by two scripts: 

- `transcribe.py` which gets in input a dna.txt file composed by nucleotides and writes a rna.txt
   as output
- `translate.py` which accepts a rna.txt as input and produce a peptide.txt


# Build the image: 

We create an image, called `vinoj_challenge`, and build it using the `Dockerfile`.

	docker build -t vinoj_challenge .
	
# We can launch a container, and see if we have everything we need.

	docker run -it vinoj_challenge bash
	
# Launch our scripts from the container:

Challenge Part1:

	$ docker run challenge_part1.py


Challenge Part2:
	$ docker run challenge_part2.py
