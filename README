## CoinPanel Backend Engineer Challenge

# Build the image: 

	docker build -t vinoj_challenge .

# Launch Container

	docker run -it vinoj_challenge bash

# Brief
The workflow is composed of two scripts: 

- `challenge_part1.py` 
    * It records all data in a dictionary where all symbols are the key.
    * It dynamically adds new symbol in the dictionary and all values from stream are recorded in pandas dataframe.
    * Stream data event time is set as index.
    * After receiving Ctrl-C it dumps the final dicionary in a pickle file

- `challenge_part2.py` 
    * After executing this script it takes user input, refer below lines
        Enter Symbol to monitor (eg: BNBBTC,ETHBTC,BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,etc..): BTCUSDT
        Enter price to monitor BTCUSDT symbol: 43680
    * It records mini-ticker statistics as per user input for SYMBOL
    * It accepts price level to monitor from user
    * If last price is more than user price level then message is printed
        <timestamp> <symbol> price has gone above <user price level> Last price: <last price from stream>
    * After receiving Ctrl-C it exits
